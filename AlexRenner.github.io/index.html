		<p>Looking at Rotten Tomato's site I liked the layout but was not a fan of the bulky web advertising block that shoved the important content off to the right of the main web page.  I did like the floating share section that allowed for social media sharing.  One major thing that I didn't understand when inspecting the page's source code was that within the main body of the website the advertisement space was highlighted as part of it but I couldn't actually find the code for the ad space within the main body section of code.</p>
